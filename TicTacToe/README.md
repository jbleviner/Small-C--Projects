# Tic-Tac-Toe Mini Project
Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe**, a console-based implementation of the classic game! This program is designed to be flexible, allowing gameplay between two players, a player and a computer, or even two computers battling it out.

## Game Rules
1. Players take turns placing their mark ('X' or 'O') on an empty square on the grid.
2. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
4. Players cannot override a square once it is filled.

2. Select "Start New Game" from the main menu.
3. Choose the game mode. (Player vs. Player, Player vs. CPU, CPU vs. CPU)
5. Enter your moves in the format row column (e.g., 1 1 for the top-left corner).
6. The game continues until thereâ€™s a winner or a draw.
7. After the game ends, choose to replay or return to the main menu.
