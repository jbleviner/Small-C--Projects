# Book Manager Project
Welcome to **Book Manager**, a console-based application for managing your personal library and _To Be Read_ (TBR) list! This project allows you to organize your books, track reading goals, and manage metadata like tagsâ€”all from an intuitive console interface.

## How to Use
- Run the application from your console or an IDE such as Visual Studio.
- Select an item from the Main Menu Options:
  - View Shelf and TBR: Display all books currently stored.
  - Add Book: Add new books to your shelf or TBR list.
  - Organize Books: Move books between lists or remove them.
  - Manage Tags: Add or remove tags for any book.
  - Exit: Save your changes and close the application.
- When adding a book, you will be prompted to provide a Title, Author, Price and Tags.
- Once they have been input, books are categorized as either "Books on Shelf" or "Books in TBR" and then saved to a file.
